# 🚀 HTML Mastery: Almost Every Tag Explored 💡

Hi everyone! 👋  
Welcome to my **HTML Learning Repository**, where I've documented and practiced almost **every HTML tag** — including many **deprecated tags**, **semantic tags**, and **lesser-known tags** that are rarely discussed in detail.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

🔍 I wanted to go beyond basic tutorials and actually **understand** how every HTML tag works.  
I watched hours of content from **YouTubers**, **senior developers**, read **[MDN HTML Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)** and had in-depth discussions with **ChatGPT** to clear my concepts.  
This repo is proof of my dedication to **web development fundamentals** 💻.

## ✨ What You'll Find Here

✅ Real examples of:

- All standard tags like `<a>`, `<p>`, `<form>`, `<img>`, `<table>`, etc.  
- Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<summary>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`  
- Form tags and attributes like `<input>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<textarea>`, and custom field areas  
- Advanced and underused tags like `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<abbr>`, `<progress>`  
- Deprecated tags like `<marquee>`, `<center>`, `<font>`, `<tt>`, and many more (with examples inside `<details>`)

## 🧠 Why This Matters

💪 I believe **strong fundamentals** make great developers.  
HTML may look simple — but it's the foundation of the web. Mastering it makes you a better:

- Front-end developer 👨‍💻  
- Designer who understands structure 🎨  
- Backend or full-stack dev who respects the browser 🧩
